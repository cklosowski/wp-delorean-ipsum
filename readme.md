WordPress Delorean Ipsum
==============
This project is only possible thanks to the awesome work of Iain Poulson ([polevaultweb](https://github.com/polevaultweb)) and his [Delorean Ipsum Generator](https://github.com/polevaultweb/DeLorean-Ipsum) JavaScript project.

## So what does this do?
Are you tired of continuing to put the same boring "Lorem Ipsum" text in your WordPress posts when in development? Me too, and thanks to Ian, I've had deloreanipsum.com for some time now. No longer are my devleopmnt environments boring and in Latin. I get to relive the journey of Marty, Doc and Jennifer as they have run-ins with the likes of Biff, Griff, and epic skateboarding chase scenes.

With a click of a button, you are given the oppertunity to fill your content area with some lines from the Back to the Future movies. Configure it how you prefer, and click 'Insert' and no longer will you have boring filler content.
