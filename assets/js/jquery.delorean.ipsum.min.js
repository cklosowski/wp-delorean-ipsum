He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him."};delorean[100]={"character":"Linda","line":"Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance."};
delorean[101]={"character":"Lorraine","line":"No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George?

Doc"};delorean[108]={"character":"Doc","line":"Marty, you made it."};delorean[109]={"character":"Marty","line":"Yeah."};delorean[110]={"character":"Doc","line":"Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life."};
delorean[111]={"character":"Marty","line":"Um, well it's a delorean, right?"};delorean[112]={"character":"Doc","line":"Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed."};delorean[113]={"character":"Marty","line":"Doc, is that a de-"};delorean[114]={"character":"Doc","line":"Never mind that now, never mind that now."};delorean[115]={"character":"Marty","line":"Alright, I'm ready."};delorean[116]={"character":"Doc","line":"Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it."};
delorean[117]={"character":"Marty","line":"Whoa, whoa, okay."};delorean[118]={"character":"Doc","line":"Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch."};delorean[119]={"character":"Marty","line":"Right check, Doc."};delorean[120]={"character":"Doc","line":"Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head."};delorean[121]={"character":"Marty","line":"You have this thing hooked up to the car?"};delorean[122]={"character":"Doc","line":"Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds."};
delorean[123]={"character":"Marty","line":"Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein."};delorean[124]={"character":"Doc","line":"Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact."};delorean[125]={"character":"Marty","line":"Where the hell are they."};delorean[126]={"character":"Doc","line":"The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine."};
delorean[127]={"character":"Marty","line":"Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean."};delorean[128]={"character":"Doc","line":"The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out."};delorean[129]={"character":"Marty","line":"What, what is it hot?"};delorean[130]={"character":"Doc","line":"It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking."};
delorean[131]={"character":"Marty","line":"He's alright."};delorean[132]={"character":"Doc","line":"He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955."};
delorean[133]={"character":"Marty","line":"What, I don't get what happened."};delorean[134]={"character":"Doc","line":"That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor."};delorean[135]={"character":"Marty","line":"The flux capacitor."};
delorean[136]={"character":"Doc","line":"It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees."};delorean[137]={"character":"Marty","line":"This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?"};
delorean[138]={"character":"Doc","line":"Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium."};delorean[139]={"character":"Marty","line":"Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?"};delorean[140]={"character":"Doc","line":"Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need."};delorean[141]={"character":"Marty",
"line":"Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off?"};delorean[142]={"character":"Doc","line":"Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts."};delorean[143]={"character":"Marty","line":"Jesus."};delorean[144]={"character":"Doc","line":"Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload."};delorean[145]={"character":"Doc",
"line":"Safe now, everything's let lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics."};delorean[146]={"character":"Marty","line":"The future, it's where you're going?"};delorean[147]={"character":"Doc","line":"That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series."};
delorean[148]={"character":"Marty","line":"Uh, Doc."};delorean[149]={"character":"Doc","line":"Huh?"};delorean[150]={"character":"Marty","line":"Uh, look me up when you get there."};delorean[151]={"character":"Doc","line":"Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty."};
